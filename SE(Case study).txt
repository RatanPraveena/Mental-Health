                      Campus Mental Health Support Chatbot



Abstract:

This project aims to develop a conversational chatbot tailored to provide round-the-clock mental health support and resources for students facing mental health challenges within a campus environment. The chatbot will offer a user-friendly interface through which students can access a wide range of services, including mood tracking, coping strategies, self-care tips, and referrals to counseling services. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the chatbot will engage in personalized conversations with users, allowing them to express their concerns and receive appropriate support in real-time. By offering 24/7 accessibility and anonymity, the chatbot aims to overcome barriers to seeking help and promote early intervention for mental health issues among students. Additionally, the chatbot will be designed to comply with privacy regulations and maintain confidentiality of user data, ensuring a secure and trustful interaction environment. Through continuous feedback and iteration, the chatbot will evolve to better meet the evolving needs of the campus community and enhance overall mental health support services on campus.
